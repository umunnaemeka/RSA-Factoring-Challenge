# RSA-Factoring-Challenge

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering studies** at ALX Software Programm. It aims to learn about RSA factoring an ultimate encryption solution which can be used **for digital signatures and for key exchange**.

## Technologies
* Scripts written in Bash 4.3.11(1)
* C files are compiled using `gcc 4.8.4`
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are scripts and programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `factors` | Factorize as many numbers as possible into a product of two smaller numbers. |
| `rsa` | The problem is to find these two primes, given only n |
